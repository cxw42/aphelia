I'm smol so I fit in only a weally smol C file. I'm lightning quick; you should watch me run ;) The big bullies like i3 and XFCE have got nothing on *this* hot piece of work, hehe.

## Force me to do things for you @_@

 * Push window backwards `Alt+a`
 * Pull window forward `Alt+s`
 * Kill window `Alt+q` X_X
 * Open *Konsole* `Alt+Return`
 * Put me to sleepy byes `Alt+Backspace`
 * Put a boi in his place `Alt+Left Click`
 * Make a small boi a big boi `Alt+Right Click`

## Put me in your file system ô¿ô 

Rawr, did I scare you? *giggle*

Put me together:
```
sudo make all
```

Tear me apart:
```
sudo clean
```

## Fork me, daddy ¯`·.¸><(((º>  

Fork this bad girl and maybe you can make your way into my contributors. ((ºjº)) Pull-requests are more than welcome ^_^
